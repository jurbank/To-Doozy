# To-Doozy

> A simple to-do app built with the primary purpose of learning [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org).

## Much of the code is based on the following tutorials:

* [Connected to the Backbone](https://tutsplus.com/course/connected-to-the-backbone/)
* [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)

Still a work-in-progress - A few of the major items:

* Remove active on click-complete
* Restructure Sass for easy theming
